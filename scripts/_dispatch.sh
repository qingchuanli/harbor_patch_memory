#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/_dispatch.sh — internal dispatcher invoked by the tmux launcher.
#
# Reads a list of chain ids (one per line) from $CHAIN_LIST_FILE, runs
# them through ``run_chain.py`` with concurrency $PARALLEL.
#
# Each chain runs as its OWN session leader (``setsid``), so the chain
# can be killed cleanly by sending a signal to its process group ID.
#
# Required env (all set by launch_runs.sh):
#   PROJECT_ROOT           absolute path to the harbor_patch_memory repo
#   DATASET                path to Terminal-shift-main dataset
#   VARIANT                "pm" or "baseline"
#   TRIALS_DIR             where harbor writes trial outputs
#   LOGS_DIR               $TRIALS_DIR/_logs/runner
#   CHAIN_LIST_FILE        text file: one chain id per line
#   PARALLEL               int; max chains running concurrently
#   HARBOR_BIN             path to the harbor CLI
#   PYTHON_BIN             python interpreter that has harbor_patch_memory installed
#
# Optional env:
#   STOP_ON_FAILURE        "1" → run_chain.py stops a chain after a task
#                          fails. Default "" → keep going (so the rest of
#                          the chain still gets memory).
#   EXTRA_RUN_CHAIN_ARGS   forwarded verbatim to run_chain.py (string)
#
# Side effects:
#   * writes $LOGS_DIR/dispatcher.pid    (this dispatcher's own pid)
#   * writes $LOGS_DIR/dispatcher.log    (mirror of stdout/stderr)
#   * per chain id ``X`` written to $LOGS_DIR/:
#       chain.X.log    full stdout/stderr from ``run_chain.py``
#       chain.X.pgid   pgid of the chain's process group (for kill)
#       chain.X.exit   numeric exit code once the chain has finished
